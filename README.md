# Anti-Sleep-Alarm-For-Drivers
Project Description:
The Anti-Sleep Alarm for Drivers is a safety system designed to detect drowsiness in drivers and alert them in real-time to prevent accidents. This system is built using the ATmega328P microcontroller (used in Arduino Uno), along with IR sensors or eye-blink detection modules to monitor the driver’s eye movement.
When the system detects that the driver is closing their eyes for more than a safe time threshold (indicating sleep or drowsiness), it triggers a buzzer or vibration motor to alert the driver immediately.

Key Components:
1.ATmega328P Microcontroller (Arduino Uno board).<br>
2.IR Eye Blink Sensor / EYE Blink Detection Module.
3.Buzzer (for alert).
4.Power Supply (Battery or USB).
5.LED Indicator (optional).
6.Resistors, wires, breadboard/PCB.

Working Principle:
The IR sensor continuously monitors the driver’s eye movement.
If the eye remains closed for more than a preset time (e.g., 2-3 seconds), the microcontroller identifies this as drowsiness.
The ATmega328P processes the sensor input and triggers the buzzer alarm if sleep is detected.
The driver is alerted through sound or vibration to regain attention.

Features:
Real-time drowsiness detection.
Compact and low power.
Quick response and alert generation.
Can be powered from a car's USB or battery.

Applications:
Used in cars, trucks, buses for long-distance drivers.
Can be extended for use in train pilots, machine operators, or security personnel.

Advantages:
Helps reduce road accidents due to drowsiness.
Low-cost and easy to implement.
Can be integrated with vehicle safety systems.
